This workshop introduced some new concepts like cloneable and comparable interfaces. It is a great exercise to get familiar with these concepts since they are relatively easy to implement with the examples from the lecture and slides. Cloning in Java is much easier compared to copying in C++, less logic is needed since the program does it by itself. What I found difficult about this workshop is implementing the output for the reason that the banks are unsafe in task 2, I could not figure out the logic for that because there are a lot of variables that are dependent on each other.
The program can be ran through eclipse by pressing F11 in the right directory.
