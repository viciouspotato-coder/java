This workshop expands on the concept of classes, it gave me the opportunity to work with abstract classes and class exceptions. An abstract class contains abstract functions, which are functions that get overridden by the subclass Although not necessary it is good to get into the habit of adding “@Override” before the function so that the compiler checks if a function is getting overridden and it makes it easier for a human to determine what is happening. Class exceptions allow the program to continue running even if an error that can break the program occurs, additionally it can provide feedback to the user.
The program can be ran through eclipse by pressing F11 in the right directory. Alternatively, use command prompt to open the directory and locate the jar file and use the command “java -jar workshop2.jar”.
