This workshop is relatively easy to complete, it introduced new topics like ArrayList and HashMap, although I believe I have used array list or something similar in a previous workshop. Both of them are used to stored information, they fetch their information through a key, ArrayList does so through the use of an index, while HashMap does so through a paired up key. The concepts are easy to understand, at least at the moment to complete the workshop.
The program can be ran through eclipse by pressing F11 in the right directory.
