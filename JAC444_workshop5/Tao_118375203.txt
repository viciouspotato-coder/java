This workshop has been the most difficult workshop so far. Not only did I need to get familiar with Java UI design, I also needed to understand how random access files worked. Working with JavaFX is a very unique experience, the syntax is very different from anything else I have worked with. I struggled a bit with the syntax at the start because I did not find it very intuitive. However, I believe with more practice I would eventually become proficient with it. Another big challenge I faced in this workshop is writing the content of the text field into the random access file, mostly because random access file often work with bytes, which is not a subject I am very comfortable with.
The program can be ran through eclipse by pressing F11 in the right directory. Alternatively, use command prompt to open the directory and locate the jar file and use the command “java -jar xx.jar”.
