This workshop served as an exceptionally good practice to get familiar with Java. While working on the workshop I was able to learn from my mistakes and spot the differences between java and c++. One major difference is how the class file names will cause errors if it does not match the actual class name within. I also began to understand the functions of packages. Through some trial and error, I was also able to make executable JAR files that can be ran through “java -jar <filename>.jar” in the command console.
